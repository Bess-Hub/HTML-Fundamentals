<!-- When I was like 9 or 10 years old I had my blog and I used to play with HTML A LOT, customize stuff, but my programming skills ended there basically.
        I am familiarized with many concepts, so lets review them, I remember I stopped when playing with JAVA, I got a lot of CSS stuff done.
        Will be following CODEDEX HTML tutorial to refresh my memory and learn new things

    <title>Remembering how to HTML</title>
<!-- A HTML file will follow this blueprint:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head>
                </head>
                <body>
                </body>
            </html>
-->
<!-- Do not forget to close the head before opening the body -->
  </head>

  <body>
<!-- The Body element is where all visible content should be placed -->
  
<!--In HTML we have opening tags, content and closing tags -->
    <!-- Opening tags are the "<__>" -->
    <!-- Content is what goes in between an opening tag and a closing tag -->
    <!-- Closing tags are the "</p__>" -->

  <!-- In HTML indentation is not mandatory, but it does make a cleaner code -->

  <!-- To add a line break we will need to add the <br> element -->
<br>
<!-- To add a heading style we can use <h> Heading Text Here </h> -->

  <!-- Or we can style it from 1 (bigger) to 6 (smaller) -->
<h1>Headers and Titles... Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>There are different levels of heading... Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>See how it gets smaller... Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>From 1 to 6... Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>It gets smaller... Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>And smaller... Heading level 6</h6>
<br>

  <!-- We can safely say that the p element is for paragraph what h is for header -->
<p>Paragraph text would go in here. We will not see .css files in a while, so this is pure formating in the HTML file.</p>
<br>

  <!-- Lets take a look at how to add some format to our texts in HTML, these elements goes like <b> </b> / <strong> </strong> / <i> </i> / <u> </u> / <s> </s>-->
<br><b> b element to bold text.</b>
<br><strong> strong element, which conveys the content as important, but also add the bold style</strong>
<br><i> i element to italicize text.</i>
<br><u> u element to underline text.</u>
<br><s> selement to strikethrough text.</s>
<br><br><h5> Example of HTML formatting a corporate e-mail:</h5>
</be><p><b>Cutting Down, Ramping Up:</b>
    We now have a robust strategy to deliver these mission-critical low-hanging fruits with no value-add that moves the needle at all costs and ensures accountability.
    Circling back on the Q3 forecast and looking holistically from a KPI standpoint… <b>it's time to double down</b> on our <s>#1 priority target goal objective north star</s> saving grace — <u>revenue growth</u>. Employee at cubicle 293 is spearheading this win-win initiative; a win for the company and our shareholders. Remember, we are customer-<s>centric</s>obsessed!

<!-- We can also have lists in HTML -->
    <!-- Lists can be ordered <ol> - which will be shown with numbers - or unordered <ul> - which will be shown with bullet points -->
    <!-- And the listed elements goes in between <li> not <p> nor <h> -->
    <h5> Unordered List example:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li> Tomatoes </li>
            <li> Bread </li>
            <li> Olive oil </li>
            <li> Salt </li>
          </ul>
    <br>
    <h5> Ordered List example:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li> Grate the tomatoes in the thick part of the grater </li>
            <li> Spread on top of the bread </li>
            <li> Add olive oil and salt </li>
          </ol>
  
<!-- The <a></a> is an anchor element. I remember I did not quite understand the anchor element back in the days.
Now I understand that anchor and links and buttons have different purposes.
The HTML anchor element defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page, therefore the href is a main element, otherwise it will be a fancy p element.
*I use the word element, but in HTML tag is more appropriate.
The HTML link element defines a link between a document and an external resource and it is usually not clickable, I would need to code a button or something.
Also, links allow us to go from one page to another page, internal or external. Anchor links allow you to go from one PART of the SAME page to another.
The HTML button element represents a clickable element, a button.

<!-- Comments in HTML can be inline or multi-line, HTML is very friendly with those with no previous experience. But comments can also be added within an element, but I do not like using it like that -->
