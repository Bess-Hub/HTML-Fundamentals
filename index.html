<!-- When I was like 9 or 10 years old I had my blog and I used to play with HTML A LOT, customize stuff, but my programming skills ended there basically.
        I am familiarized with many concepts, so lets review them, I remember I stopped when playing with JAVA, I got a lot of CSS stuff done.
        Will be following CODEDEX HTML tutorial to refresh my memory and learn new things

<!-- Do not forget to close the head before opening the body -->
  </head>

  <body>
<!-- The Body element is where all visible content should be placed -->
  
<!--In HTML we have opening tags, content and closing tags -->
    <!-- Opening tags are the "<__>" -->
    <!-- Content is what goes in between an opening tag and a closing tag -->
    <!-- Closing tags are the "</p__>" -->

  <!-- In HTML indentation is not mandatory, but it does make a cleaner code -->

  <!-- To add a line break we will need to add the <br> element -->
<br>
<!-- To add a heading style we can use <h> Heading Text Here </h> -->
 <center><br><br><h4> Example of heading levels:</h4></center><br>
  <!-- Or we can style it from 1 (bigger) to 6 (smaller) -->
<h1>Headers and Titles... Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>There are different levels of heading... Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>See how it gets smaller... Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>From 1 to 6... Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>It gets smaller... Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>And smaller... Heading level 6</h6>
<br>
 <center><br><br><h4> Example of paragraph tag:</h4></center><br>
  <!-- We can safely say that the p element is for paragraph what h is for header -->
<p>Paragraph text would go in here. We will not see .css files in a while, so this is pure formating in the HTML file.</p>
<br>

  <!-- Lets take a look at how to add some format to our texts in HTML, these elements goes like <b> </b> / <strong> </strong> / <i> </i> / <u> </u> / <s> </s>-->
 <center><br><br><h4> Example of formatting text:</h4></center><br>
<br><b> b element to bold text.</b>
<br><strong> strong element, which conveys the content as important, but also add the bold style</strong>
<br><i> i element to italicize text.</i>
<br><u> u element to underline text.</u>
<br><s> selement to strikethrough text.</s>

<!-- We can also have lists in HTML -->
    <!-- Lists can be ordered <ol> - which will be shown with numbers - or unordered <ul> - which will be shown with bullet points -->
    <!-- And the listed elements goes in between <li> not <p> nor <h> -->
          <center><h4> Example of Unordered List:</h4></center>
        <ul>
            <li> Tomatoes </li>
            <li> Bread </li>
            <li> Olive oil </li>
            <li> Salt </li>
          </ul>
          <center><h4> Example of Ordered List:</h4></center>
          <ol>
            <li> Grate the tomatoes in the thick part of the grater </li>
            <li> Spread on top of the bread </li>
            <li> Add olive oil and salt </li>
          </ol>

<!-- The <a></a> is an anchor element. I remember I did not quite understand the anchor element back in the days.
Now I understand that anchor and links and buttons have different purposes.
The HTML anchor element defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page, therefore the href is a main element, otherwise it will be a fancy p element.
*I use the word element, but in HTML tag is more appropriate.
The HTML link element defines a link between a document and an external resource and it is usually not clickable, I would need to code a button or something.
Also, links allow us to go from one page to another page, internal or external. Anchor links allow you to go from one PART of the SAME page to another.
The HTML button element represents a clickable element, a button.

You’ve been asked to write a Wikipedia article of revered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.

Create a file called wiki.html.

Make sure to include the following:

One header that says "Biography".
An image of Miyamoto that includes alternative text.
One paragraph with at least 2 sentences.
Include at least one link in the text (like a link to Wiki article for Miyamoto or one of the games he created)
Make sure the link opens on a new browser tab when the link is clicked.

<!-- Now lets review class and id tags/elements
!! They are both used to label elements, but they are not the same:
    1 An element can have multiple class elements, but only one id.
    2 And id must be unique, a class can be repeated.
    3 Both id and class values are to be lower case and, if needed separation a dash "-" should be used
    4 Ids can be used to link a part of a text, hence the uniqueness. For this instead of a http link we will use a # followed by the id value

!! Lets explore the div element
    1. The div element is used to create different sections for a website
    2. It is common to use class and id when opening a division
    
!! EXERCISE 3

Lorem Ipsum is commonly used as placeholder content to better visualize how a web page's text should look on the final copy. Let's hone our newly learned skills!

1. Add a top-level <h1> header element that says "Draft Title".
2. Add two <a> anchor elements.
    2.1 One link should contain text that says "Heading 1" and the other "Heading 2".
    2.2 Give each link an href attribute with a value of #heading-x.
3. Underneath, create two <div> elements with a class value of "section".
    3.1 Each <div> should contain a <h2> header element and two <p> paragraph elements.
    3.2 The headers should have a class of "heading" and an id of #heading-x.
    3.3. Each paragraph should contain the following placeholder text:
    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."
-->
        <center><h4>Exercise 3:</h4></center>

<center><h1>Draft Title</h1><center>
<a href="#heading-1">Heading 1</a>
<br>
<a href="#heading-2">Heading 2</a>
          
<br>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="heading" id="heading-2"></h2>
        <p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."</p>
    </div>

<!-- Lets start putting more style in our HTML
    While we can style each part individually, it is much easier to give certain class or id of elements the same formatting style.
    We can add that in the header directly, or use a CSS file for that, but for now lets add in HTML code, in the header part.

    It would go like:

<style>

    span {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }

    .class-name {
        color: red;
    }

    #id-name {
        color: blue;
        text-decoration: bold; 
    }

</style>

Later we would refer to those elements in the body, for example: -->
<center><h4>Example of formatting using style tag in head: </h4></center>
<p>
      Roses are <span id="id-name">red</span>.<br>
      Violets are <span class="class-name">blue</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>
<!--!! EXERCISE 4

1. Copy/paste the following in the <body> element:
<div class="ranger-div" id="red-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="blue-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="black-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="yellow-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="pink-ranger"></div>
2. Insert a <style> element in the <head>. Then, apply the following styles in the <style> element:
    A width of 50% and height of 100px for <div> divider elements with the ranger-div class.
    A different background-color for each <div> divider element based on their id.
-->
<center><h4>Exercise 4: </h4></center>
<div class="ranger-div" id="red-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="blue-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="black-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="yellow-ranger"></div>
<div class="ranger-div" id="pink-ranger"></div>
<br>

<!-- Before we continue, lets try Exercise 3 again to show how if we click on Heading 1 it will bring us here: -->
        <marquee><center><h4>Re-testing Exercise 3 - Go back up and click on Heading 1: </h4></center></marquee>
